**Apache add-on to identify friendly search engines and detect malicious web bots** such as email address harvesters and comment spammers. The rewritemap filter accesses the DNS blacklist registry compiled by [Project Honeypot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/) to reliably determine the type and threat level of robots visiting your server. Can also be used in batch mode.
